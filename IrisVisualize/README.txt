This is a data visualisation project comparing the characteristics of threes species of a flower 'Iris'.
The data was taken from the RStudio packages but I uploaded it anyway.

Description for iris.tidy:
Basic idea of tidying data is to manipulate/alter data such that:
1. Each column becomes a variable
2. Each row becomes an observation.
This is done to make data more flexible and easy to access for plotting.
Data size obviously increases because of increased number of rows/observations depending upon the modifications one makes.
In this case, data size after manipulation becomes 4 times of the original data.
